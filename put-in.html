    <p class="content">Put In is a game where you have to deal as much damage as possible to a dummy. For this, the game
        has a system of
        "building" a wide variety of traps:
        <br><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp- A circular saw is the simplest tool. It can be installed at any point on the map.
        <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp- Spikes are placed only on the top of the map.
        <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp- Knives should be placed only on the left or right side.
        <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp- Mina puts herself on the floor. It is a disposable tool. Disappears after detonation.
        <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp- Boomerang can be placed in any part of the map. It will fly from side to side. He
        changes sides when he
        collides with
        any object, except the player.
        <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp- The rocket is placed on the bottom of the map. She shoots a beam upwards. If this beam
        crosses the dummy, it
        will
        start. It is a disposable item. Upon collision with any object, it detonates. Disappears after detonation.
        <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp- A box with fireworks is placed at the bottom of the map. After placement, fireworks
        begin to fly out of the
        box in
        different directions. They, in turn, detonate upon collision with any object. After several fireworks are
        released, the
        box disappears.
        <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp- Bayraktar, when activated, stops the plane for a few seconds.
        <br><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAnd the game can be lost if the dummy catches the rescue plane. It has some
        behavioral features:
        <br><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp- The plane is heading to the dummy by the shortest route.
        <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp- If there is an obstacle on his way, he will try to bypass it.
        <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp- If it is not possible to bypass the obstacle, the plane will shoot at it and destroy
        it.
        <br><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspEach weapon has its own strength scale. After it ends, the tool breaks and
        disappears. To reveal a new item, you
        must
        cross a specified score value. In order to display an item in a game session, you need to collect the required
        amount of
        session coins.
