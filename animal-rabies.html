    <p class="content">&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAnimal Rabies is a side-view shooter. The main character needs to destroy all
        the animals that
        have gone mad in the
        city. The game features several types of animals with different abilities and behavior patterns:
        <br><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp– The pig can only walk between given points. When colliding with it, the player
        receives damage. This unit
        can
        move not
        only on a flat plane. A beam is fired from the pig that determines the nearest plane to move. Thanks to
        raycast,
        the
        unit "sticks" to the surface.
        <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp– The squirrel stands still and occasionally shoots acorns in three different directions
        (up, left, right).
        When
        colliding with a squirrel or acorn, the player receives damage.
        <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp– The chicken flies the shortest way to the player. When shot at it, thanks to the
        joint, the unit seems to
        oscillate
        from the impact. When colliding with it, the player receives damage.
        <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp– The hare stands still and shoots a carrot at the player's last position. In case of a
        collision with a
        hare
        or
        a
        carrot, the player receives damage.
        <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp– The bear hovers in the air and shoots missiles at the player that chase the player
        until they detonate.
        Rockets
        detonate upon collision with any object. When colliding with a bear or missiles, the player takes damage.
        <br><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspDuring the jump, the player does somersaults, knows how to bend. Several different
        mechanics are available
        in
        the game:
        <br><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp– There are two weapons for shooting in the game: one initial, and the other bonus.
        The
        first has an
        infinite
        number of
        bullets and a low rate of fire. The second is selected from bonuses and has a finite supply of bullets and a
        high rate of fire.
        When
        they are
        finished, the weapon disappears.
        <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp– Rocketjump is available as an active skill. When pressing the appropriate button, the
        player fires a
        weapon
        and flies
        in the opposite direction. After that, the skill becomes unavailable for a few seconds.
        <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp– Time is slowed down by pressing the appropriate button. It applies to everything
        except skill reloads and
        weapon rate
        of fire.
        <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp– The player can release a grappling hook to grab onto a surface or enemy. The hook is
        the same length as
        it
        was
        from
        the beginning, when it caught on something.
        <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp– When picking up the "HP" bonus, the player adds one life.
